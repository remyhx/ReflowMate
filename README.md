# ReflowMate

I used PCBWAY for 3D printing:

- CNC | 3D printing (upper menu)
- 3D printing
- Quantity per 5 (The initial mentioned price was reduced a lot after review by PCBWAY, takes some time)
- Tool steel (or whatever you like, but Titanium is VERY expensive
- At other special request you can ask for polishing
